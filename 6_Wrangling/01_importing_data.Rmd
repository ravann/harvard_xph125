This notebook details different aspects of importing data into R as explained in the "Data Science: Wrangling" course.


Copy murders.csv to local directory
```{r}
library(dslabs)
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
fName <- "murders.csv"
fPath <- file.path(path, fName)
file.copy(fPath, getwd()) # this code can be commented, else it runs every time we run notebook
```

Read few lines of the murders.csv to determine the format

```{r}
library(readr)
read_lines("murders.csv", n_max = 5)
```

Lets read the CSV file into a data frame

```{r}
murders1 <- read.csv("murders.csv")
class(murders1)
murders <- read_csv("murders.csv")
class(murders)
murders
```

Download the data from internet

```{r}


```
